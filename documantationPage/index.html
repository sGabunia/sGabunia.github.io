                </header>
                <p class="marked"> This book surveys what you need to be aware of as you get started with JS. The goal is to
                    fill in gaps
                    that
                    readers
                    newer to JS might have tripped over in their early encounters with the language. I also hope that we've
                    hinted
                    at enough
                    deeper detail throughout to pique your curiosity to want to dig more into the language.</p>
    
                <p>The rest of the books in this series are where we will unpack all of the rest of the language, in far
                    greater
                    detail
                    than we could have done in a few brief chapters here.</p>
    
                <p>Remember to take your time, though. Rather than rushing onto the next book in an attempt to churn through
                    all
                    the books
                    expediently, spend some time going back over the material in this book. Spend some more time looking
                    through
                    code in
                    your current projects, and comparing what you see to what's been discussed so far.</p>
    
                <p class="marked">When you're ready, this final chapter divides the organization of the JS language into
                    three
                    main pillars,
                    then offers a
                    brief roadmap of what to expect from the rest of the book series, and how I suggest you proceed. Also,
                    don't
                    skip the
                    appendices, especially Appendix B, "Practice, Practice, Practice!".</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="scopes_and_closures">
                <header>
                    Scopes and Closures
                </header>
                <p>The first is commonly called hoisting: when all variables declared anywhere in a scope are treated as if
                    they're
                    declared at the beginning of the scope. The other is that var-declared variables are function scoped,
                    even
                    if
                    they
                    appear inside a block.</p>
                <p>Neither hoisting nor function-scoped var are sufficient to back the claim that JS is not lexically
                    scoped.
                    let/const
                    declarations have a peculiar error behavior called the "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ) which results in
                    observable
                    but
                    unusable variables. Though TDZ can be strange to encounter, it's also not an invalidation of lexical
                    scoping.
                    All of
                    these are just unique parts of the language that should be learned and understood by all JS developers.

                <p>My suggestion for most readers is to <code>proceed</code> through this series in this order:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get started with a solid foundation of JS from Get Started (Book 1) -- good news, you've already
                        almost
                        finished this
                        book!</li>
                    <li>In Scope & Closures (Book 2), dig into the first pillar of JS: lexical scope, how that supports
                        closure,
                        and how the
                        module pattern organizes code.</li>
                    <li>Objects & Classes (Book 3), focus on the second pillar of JS: how JS's this works, how object
                        prototypes
                        support
                        delegation, and how prototypes enable the class mechanism for OO-style code organization.</li>
                    <li>In Types & Grammar (Book 4), tackle the third and final pillar of JS: types and type coercion, as
                        well
                        as
                        how JS's
                        syntax and grammar define how we write our code.</li>
                    <li>With the three pillars solidly in place, Sync & Async (Book 5) then explores how we use flow control
                        to
                        model state
                        change in our programs, both synchronously (right away) and asynchronously (over time).</li>

                <p class="marked">I have some advice to share on continuing your learning journey with JS, and your path
                    through the rest of
                    this book
                    series: be aware of the grain (recall various references to grain earlier in this chapter).</p>
                <p>First, consider the grain (as in, wood) of how most people approach and use JS. You've probably already
                    noticed that
                    these books cut against that grain in many <code>proceed</code>. In YDKJSY, I respect you the reader
                    enough
                    to
                    explain all
                    the parts
                    of JS, not only some select popular parts. I believe you're both capable and deserving of that
                    knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>But I've also had many people tell me that they quoted some topic/explanation from these books during a
                    job
                    interview,
                    and the interviewer told the candidate they were wrong; indeed, people have reportedly lost out on job
                    offers
                    as a
                    result.</p>
    
            </section>
    
            <section class="main-section" id="with_the_grain">
                <header>
                    with the grain
                </header>
                <p>Can you make your JS program look like a Java, C#, or Perl program? What about Python or Ruby, or even
                    PHP?
                    To varying
                    degrees, sure you can. But should you?</p>
                <p>No, I don't think you should. I think you should learn and embrace the JS way, and make your JS programs
                    as
                    JS'y as is
                    practical. Some will think that means <code>proceed</code> and informal programming, but I don't mean
                    that
                    at
                    all. I just
                    mean that JS
                    has a lot of patterns and idioms that are recognizably "JS," and going with that grain is the general
                    path
                    to
                    best
                    success.</p>
                <p>That's the most important advice I can impart to help you learn JS. Always keep looking for better ways
                    to
                    use what JS
                    gives us to author more readable code. Everyone who works on your code, including your future self, will
                    thank
                    you!</p>

                <header>
                    In Order
                </header>
                <p>However, Books 2, 3, and 4 can generally be read in any order, depending on which topic you feel most
                    curious
                    about and
                    comfortable exploring first. But I don't recommend you skip any of these three books—not even Types &
                    Grammar,
                    as some
                    of you will be tempted to do!—even if you <code>proceed</code> you already have that topic down.</p>
                <p>Book 5 (Sync & Async) is crucial for deeply understanding JS, but if you start digging in and find it's
                    too
                    intimidating, this book can be deferred until you're more experienced with the language. The more JS
                    you've
                    written (and
                    struggled with!), the more you'll come to appreciate this book. So don't be afraid to come back to it at
                    a
                    later
                    time.</p>
                <p>The final book in the series, ES.Next & Beyond, in some respects stands alone. It can be read at the end,
                    as
                    I
                    suggest,
                    or right after Getting Started if you're <code>proceed</code> a shortcut to broaden your radar of what
                    JS is
                    all
                    about.
                    This book
                    will also be more likely to receive updates in the future, so you'll probably want to re-visit it
                    occasionally.
                </p>
                <p>However you choose to proceed with YDKJSY, check out the appendices of this book first, especially
                    practicing
                    the
                    snippets in Appendix B, "Practice, Practice, Practice!" Did I mention you should go practice!? There's
                    no
                    better
                    way to
                    learn code than to write it.</p>
                <p>So now you've got a broader perspective on what's left to explore in JS, and the right attitude to
                    approach
                    the
                    rest of
                    your journey.</p>
                <p>But one of the most common practical questions I get at this point is, "What order should I read the
                    books?"
                    There is a
                    straightforward answer... but it also depends.</p>
